To Compile:
Use the `make` command to invoke the Makefile and create the executables `worker` and `oss`.
The `clockUtils` files are library code created for the executables that get compiled into them when `make` is executed.
When oss is executed, it creates a file called `keyfile.txt`. That is necessary for the program to run but it is recreated at runtime if it does not exist.

These tools use a simulated clock so times displayed may not be accurate to realtime. On most modern machines it will run much faster than realtime.

worker:
Tool that intakes 2 arguments. That argument is the amount of time the worker will run for.
The first argument being the amount of seconds and the second being the amount of nanoseconds.
The arguments are integers and have a minumum value of 1. Invalid inputs will be defaulted to 1.

oss:
Tool with 6 different options. It invokes `worker` processes and continues until all instances are created and finished.
Usage: oss [-h] [-n proc] [-s simul] [-t time] [-i interv] [-f logfile]
-h : Print options for the oss tool and exits
-n : Total number of processes to run (default: 1)
-s : Maximum number of simultaneously running processes. Maximum of 20 (defaults to max value)
-t : Workers are executed with a random amount of time, this defines the maximum number of seconds that workers will run (default: 1)
-i : Interval (in ms) to launch child processes (default: 0)
-f : Specify a filename to save a copy of oss's logs to (disabled by default)
Every half second it prints the process table of its children.
After 60 real-life seconds (not using the simulated clock) it will shut down as a failsafe.
