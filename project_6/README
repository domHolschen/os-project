This simulates an operating system process that allocates child process memory into pages and frames.

To Compile:
Use the `make` command to invoke the Makefile and create the executables `worker` and `oss`.
The `clockUtils` files are library code created for the executables that get compiled into them when `make` is executed.
When oss is executed, it creates a file called `keyfile.txt`. That is necessary for the program to run but it is recreated at runtime if it does not exist.

These tools use a simulated clock so times displayed may not be accurate to realtime. On most modern machines it will run much faster than realtime.
They use a message queue to communicate requests or if they are terminating.

NOTE: There tends to be issues with forking when -n is around 20 or greater on the opsys server. This may not hold true if ran on another machine.

worker:
Tool that requests a random memory address between 1-32k via sending a message to its parent process, oss.
Intended to not be invoked by itself but by oss to simulate making the requests to access memory.

oss:
Tool with 6 different options. It invokes `worker` processes and continues until all instances are created and finished.
Usage: oss [-h] [-n proc] [-s simul] [-t time] [-i interv] [-f logfile]
-h : Print options for the oss tool and exits
-n : Total number of processes to run (default: 1)
-s : Maximum number of simultaneously running processes. Maximum of 18 (defaults to max value)
-i : Interval (in ms) to launch child processes (default: 0)
-f : Specify a filename to save a copy of oss's logs to (disabled by default). If the file does not exist, it is created. Note that it overwrites the data each time it is ran
Each page is 1KB, each process gets 32KB, and the frame table holds 256 entries.
Every half second it prints the frame table and the page table of each process.
After 5 real-life seconds (not using the simulated clock) it will shut down as a failsafe.
